# Specimen Paper _ Software Engineering and Project Management


### Question 1 – Requirements Elicitation

* a) Needs of customers are identified during requirements elicitation. Describe two challenges faced by software development professionals in requirements elicitation. [3 marks]

> [Total 3 marks] Software developers may not have the application domain knowledge to fully understand the requirements written in users’ terminology. User requirements change. (Other reasonable answers are accepted.)

* b) Write a functional requirement for a library system. [2 marks]

> [Total 2 marks] The system allows a library card holder to check out a book.


* c) Write a non-functional requirement for a library system. [2 marks]

> [Total 2 marks] The system response time should be within 3 seconds after scanning a book for the checkout function.

* d) State whether the use of prototypes can alleviate challenges encountered in requirements elicitation. Give justification. [3 marks]

> [Total 3 marks] Yes, the use of prototypes can alleviate challenges encountered in requirements elicitation. [1 mark] Prospective users can try the prototype. The experience based on the look-and-feel of the prototype is more accurate than just reading or hearing a description of the system. Prospective users can give more reliable feedback to software development professionals. [2 marks]

### Question 2 – UML Modelling and Use Cases

* **a) Describe what is a software model and the purpose of using it in software development. [3 marks]**

> A software model is an abstract description of a system’s specific aspects. [1 mark] It facilitates the communication of software development team members. [2 marks]

* **b) Draw a suitable UML diagram to express a simplified university registration process described below. The four activities to show in the diagram have been italicized. The student will fill out an enrollment form. If he or she filled out the form incorrectly, he will need to do it again until the form is correct. The student will then enroll in the university. After that, two activities can happen in parallel. One activity is that the student will attend a university orientation session. The other activity is that the student will make initial tuition payment. [8 mark]**
